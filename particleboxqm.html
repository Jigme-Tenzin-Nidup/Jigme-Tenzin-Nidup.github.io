                                <p>A photo from the 1927 Solvay Conference shows a group of Physicists together in a frame. The image, also called “the most intelligent picture ever taken”, consists of individuals like Einstein, Marie Curie, Planck and Niels Bohr. It was an international gathering of top scientists around the world to discuss the newly formulated quantum theory. It is at this conference that Einstein famously expressed his discontentment with the consequences of the theory, stating, “God doesn’t play dice”, as a strong believer in a deterministic universe. Bohr was on the other side of the argument, defending the new theory as a novel approach for fundamental understanding of the Universe. </p>

                                <p>Among the attendees was Erwin Schrödinger, whose formulation of the wave equation offered a powerful mathematical framework to describe subatomic particles as wave-like entities. This idea, of course, stemmed from De Broglie’s wave-particle hypothesis, who was also in that crowd that day. Schrödinger’s equation becomes one of the cornerstones of quantum theory, improving on our classical understanding of the classical world through the lens of probabilistic wavefunctions.</p>
                                
                                <p>The shift from determinism to probability during the latter half of the twentieth century marked a revolution in Physics. Classical mechanics had failed to account for certain experimental results, most notably, the ultraviolet catastrophe and the photoelectric effect. Schrödinger’s equation provided a new lens to interpret these phenomena. </p>
                                
                                <p>One of the applications on a fundamental level is the “Particle in a Box” - a simple but inherently profound model that captures the essence of quantum confinement, quantization of energy, and the probabilistic nature of a particle’s position in space. This section will explore the basic application, laying the groundwork for deeper insights into quantum systems and further technological applications.</p>

                            <h2>Wave Function</h2>
                            <p>Following de Broglie’s hypothesis that particles such as electrons exhibit wave-like properties, an essential question arises: what does this wave-like behaviour look like, and how do we interpret it? This leads to the concept of the wavefunction, a mathematical tool used to describe the behaviour of quantum particles. </p>

                            <p> The earlier description of the wave function, denoted by the Greek letter \(\psi\) (Psi), came from Erwin Schrödinger himself. Schrodinger introduced the wavefunction as a way to represent how particles are spread out through space. Originally, it was envisioned as a real physical distribution of the particle’s properties, very similar to that of water droplets dispersed across a surface. For electrons, he considered that charge itself must be spread out over the space. </p>

                            <p>However, Max Born, one of Schrödinger’s contemporaries, provided a different interpretation. Born proposed that the wavefunction doesn’t represent a literal spread of physical matter or charge. Rather, it includes the probability amplitude of finding a particle at a given location in the region. Mathematically, the probability density can be evaluated by finding the square of the wavefunction’s magnitude \(|\psi(x)|^2\). The graphical descriptions of the wavefunction and the probability density will be explored in the coming sections of the subject. </p>
                                
                             <p> This probabilistic nature marked a significant leap from classical deterministic physics. Schrödinger himself was against Born’s explanation, citing his famous Schrödinger’s cat thought experiment to illustrate his discomfort with its quantum properties. </p>   
                                
                              <p>The apparent differences between classical and quantum mechanics can be discussed by analysing the results of the probability distribution. Take this distribution curve for example. Integrating the distribution over a certain range gives us the probability of finding the particle within the set range. For the distribution above, the probability will yield either 0 or 1 based on whether the particle is within the range or not. In contrast, for a quantum particle, the range is more spread out and pronounced. Integrating over a specific range will only give us a fraction of 1. The fraction increases as you approach the peak of the curve, indicating where the particle can most likely be found. </p>  
                                
                               <p>In order to ensure that the particle be found, we normalize the wavefunction by integrating the probability density over the entire space. We get the value to be 1 upon integration, which confirms the existence of the particle within the huge confines of space we have defined.</p> 
                                
                               <p>Despite the debates, Born’s interpretation remains the foundation of modern quantum mechanics and continues to be the stronger proponent for a wavefunction. It describes how quantum particle behaves, how it evolves over periods and more importantly, allows us to discover where the particle is likely to be found. While the debate on a more fundamental implication of wavefunction as a concept remains open for further explanation, Born’s view on wavefunction dominates our practical use-case scenario.</p>

                            <h2>Finding the solution to the Time Independent Schrödinger’s Equation</h2>
                            <p>The Time Independent Schrödinger Equation describes the stationary states of the particle, which are independent of time. The equation essentially describes a mathematical eigen value problem:</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                            \[
                                H\psi(x) = E\psi(x)
                            \]
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>The wavefunction in this regard, are the eigenfunctions, and the corresponding E are the eigenvalues. The resultant Eigenvalues are quantized energy of the system. These specifics allow only a discrete amount of energies to be exist depending on our boundary conditions of the system.
                            Solving the Time Independent Schrodinger Equation enables us to obtain the wavefunction, which in turn provides the probability distribution of the particle’s position. One of many applications as a result will be explored as we solve the Time Independent Schrödinger Equation for a particle in a box. 
                            Since we are considering a 1-Dimensional problem, the mathematical form of the equation in 1D is given below:
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                                \[
                                    \frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2\psi(x)}{dx^2} + V(x)\psi(x) = E\psi(x)
                                \]
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Where:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>\(
                                            \psi(x)
                                        \) - Position dependent Wavefunction
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        \(V(x)\) - Potential Energy function
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                       \(E\) - Total Energy
                                    </li>
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                                By comparing the two equations, we find the \(H\) is the Hamiltonian Operator, representing the sum of  Kinetic and Potential Energy of the system
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Consider the Particle in the Box below:</p>

                            <figure>
                                    <img src="./Img/infinite potential well.png" alt="">

                            </figure>
                            <p>Within the region 0 < x < a, the particle experience zero potential, allowing the particle to exist freely between the confines. Our goal is to determine the allowed energy states of the particle, obtain its wavefunction and the probabilty density distribution, which will describe where the particle will most likely be found. </p>
                            <p>In this scenario, a particle is confined with the region between x = 0 and x = a, where the potential V(x) = 0. Outside this region, the potential V(x) = ∞ meaning the particle cannot exist beyond these boundaries. </p>
                            <p>Given the Time Independent Schödinger Equation, we know the potential energy of the system \(V(x)\) to be 0. The resultant equation is given:</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                                \[
                                \frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2\psi(x)}{dx^2} = E\psi(x)
                                \]
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>By the process of simple algebraic rearrangement, we obtain our second order differential equation:</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                                \[
                                \frac{d^2\psi(x)}{dx^2} + \frac{2mE}{\hbar^2}\psi(x) = 0
                                \]
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>For further simplification, we will assign a variable to the coefficient of \(\psi(x)\) as follows:</p>
                            <p>
                                \[k^2  = \frac{2mE}{\hbar^2} \]
                                Hence, our final differential equation looks something like this:
                                \[
                                \frac{d^2\psi(x)}{dx^2} + k^2\psi(x) = 0
                                \]
                                This is a transcendental equation and by solving this, we find a general expression to the wavefunction, which would look something like this:
                                \[
                                \psi(x) = Acoskx + Bsinkx
                                \]
                                Where A and B are constants we can determine using boundary conditions. The boundary conditions are the given set of conditions the wavefunction must follow. In this case, there are two boundary conditions:
                                <br>

                                        The solution of the wavefunction at region x = 0 must be 0:
                                        \[
                                        \psi(0) = 0
                                        \]
                                    </li>

                                        The solution of the wavefunction at region x = a must be 0:
                                        \[
                                        \psi(a) = 0
                                        \]
                                    </li>
                                </ol>
                                Using the 1st Boundary Condition, we get:
                                \[\psi(0) = 0 = Acosk(0) + Bsink(0)\]
                                \[0 = A + 0\]
                                \[A = 0\]

                                Therefore, we get the resultant wavefunction as:
                                \[\psi(x) = Bsinkx\]

                                Using the 2nd Boundary Condition:
                                \[\psi(a) = 0 = Bsink(a)\]
                                \[0 = Bsin(ka)\]
                                \[0 = sin(ka)\]
                                We know that \(sin(x) = 0\) at \(x = 0, \pi, 2\pi, 3\pi...\)
                                <br>
                                This means that at any value of x that is a multiple of \(\pi\), the result is 0. Therefore:
                                \[sin(n\pi) = sin(ka)\]
                                \[n\pi = ka\]
                                \[k = \frac{n\pi}{a}\]
                                With our obtained value of k, our wavefunction looks like this:
                                \[\psi(x) = Bsin(\frac{n\pi}{a})x\]

                               Lastly, we normalize the wavefunction within the boundary x = 0 to x = a, where we know we will find our particle. By this process, we will be able to obtain the value of the coefficeint B:
                               \[
                               \int_{0}^{a} |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1
                               \]
                               \[
                                \int_{0}^{a} Bsin(\frac{n\pi}{a}x)*Bsin(\frac{n\pi}{a}x)dx = 1
                               \]
                               \[
                               B^2\int_{0}^{a} sin^2(\frac{n\pi}{a}x)dx = 1
                               \]
                               \[
                               \frac{B^2}{2}\int_{0}^{a} [1 - cos2(\frac{n\pi}{a}x)dx] = 1 .................. (sin^2x = \frac{1-cos2x}{2})
                               \]
                               By solving the Integral now, we get:
                               \[
                               \frac{B^2}{2} [ a - \frac{sin2(n\pi)}{2\frac{n\pi}{a}} ]= 1
                               \]
                               \[
                               \frac{B^2}{2} [a - \frac{0}{2\frac{n\pi}{a}}] = 1
                               \]
                               \[
                               \frac{B^2}{2} [a] = 1
                               \]
                               \[
                               B = \sqrt\frac{2}{a}
                               \]

                               So our final equation looks like this:
                               \[
                               \psi(x) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{a}}sin(\frac{n\pi}{a}x)
                               \]
 
                             </p>

                                <p>
                                    Wave function for each energy level is determined by the integer value n. Subsequently, the wavefunction also has a corresponding Energy Eigen Value, which is also based on the specific quantized energy level.
                               <br>
                               We know:
                               \[
                               k = \frac{n\pi}{a}
                               \]
                               We also know:
                               \[
                               k^2 = \frac{2mE}{\hbar^2}
                               \]

                               Therefore, by simple rearrangement substitution, we get:
                               \[
                               E = \frac{\hbar^2n^2\pi^2}{2ma^2}
                               \]

    <h2>Physical Significance of the Result</h2>
    <p>The concept of the Particle in a Box is an idealized application of the Schrodinger Equation, more mathematical and abstract than directly physical. However, the principles applied form the very foundation of our understanding of atomic structure. If you take the Bohr Model of the hydrogen atom, the electron is visualized as orbiting the nucleus along a fixed circular path. But with our current understanding of quantum mechanics, it became clear that such a deterministic framework doesn’t apply to physical reality.</p>
    <p>The electron’s position around the nucleus is described by a probability cloud, where the electron is likely to be found, without certainty of course. The 1D particle in a Box Model allows us to understand a single quantum particle confined within boundaries, having discrete energy levels and a wavefunction describing the probabilistic presence in space. Similarly, the electrons in atoms are bound by the potential of the nucleus and occupy quantised orbitals defined by wavefunctions. </p>

    <p>Although simplified, the particle in a box captures the core of Quantum Mechanics, and I found that rather convincingly beautiful. It is almost something along the lines of what Feynman wanted the world to be. Einstein never fathomed a God playing Dice. But he was wrong to tell God what to do. The tapestry of natural science resides not in the grandeur of knowledge filled with secular understanding, but in the acceptance of ignorance and the charming way to present itself throughout the Universe. As far as we are concerned, we are the only ones lucky enough to be talking about this in great lengths and greater fashion. Again, I find that rather convincingly beautiful.</p>
