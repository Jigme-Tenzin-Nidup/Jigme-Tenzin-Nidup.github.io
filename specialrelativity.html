                            <h2>Laying the Historical Foundation</h2>
                            <p>In 1905, a young German patent clerk would forever change our view of space and time. That person, being Einstein, paved a new era in the study of space, motion and light through the Special Theory of Relativity. We will delve into this theory conceptually as well as analytically and see how it redefined our understanding of where we stand in the cosmos. .</p>  
                            <p>Born in 1879, Einstein grew up in Germany, and from a young age, he was captivated by nature’s hidden forces, a fascination sparked by a compass given to him by his father. He was not a child prodigy in the traditional sense and faced constant academic hurdles. Later, through the help of a friend, he secured a job at the Swiss Patent Office, where he used his spare time to think deeply about Physics.</p>
                            <p> Einstein didn’t come up with this theory out of the blue. As we shall learn, a few scientific discoveries and achievements influenced his theory. By laying out this groundwork of scientific accomplishments, we can get an idea of how Einstein was influenced by these ideas, which eventually led to his achievements. We will look at a few in quick successions here below:</p>
                            <p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>The invention of Battery (1800)</b> - Alessandro Volta's battery enabled exploration of electrical phenomena </li>
                                <li><b>Young's Double Slit Experiment (1801)</b> - Demonstrated the wave nature of light</li>
                                <li><b>Electromagnetism and Maxwell's Equations (1820s - 1870s)</b> -  Maxwell showed that the speed of light was the same as the speed of electromagnetic waves, further proving the wave nature of light.</li>
                                <li><b>Michelson-Morley Experiment(1880s) </b> - Set the stage for Einstein's insight  </li>
                            </ul> Even the rise of railroads influenced Einstein as his thought experiments often involved trains and observers

                            <h2>Annus Mirabilis - Einstein’s miracle year</h2>
                            <p>
                                1905 marked a significant leap in our scientific understanding as Einstein published 4 major papers that continue to be studied to this day. This is but a small description to all four of the papers

                                    <li><b>March - Light Quanta</b>: Light, traditionally seen as a wave, could also behave like particle, as evidence by the photoelectric effect. This paper laid the foundation for Quantum Physics</li>
                                    <li><b>May - Atomic Theory</b>: Einstein approached the question of the atom's existence, which, during his time, was being debated. He made a staggering hypothesis stating that Brownian Motion (molecules randomly moving in a liquid) could be analyzed by the collision of atoms. This hypothesis was later confirmed, and scepticism surrounding the existence of the atom ended. </li>
                                    <li><b>June - The Paper on the Electrodynamics of moving bodies</b>: Einstein resolved contradictions between Newtonian mechanics and Maxwell’s electromagnetism, leading to revolutionary conclusions about space and time.</li>

                            <h2>The Nature of light</h2>
                            <p>Earlier on, the nature of light had been the subject of deep curiosity. Was it a wave, or was it a particle? We now have an understanding that it exhibits a dual property. This makes light one of the most fascinating entities in the observable universe. If it were purely a wave, it should follow the basic premises below:</p>
                            <p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Speed of light depends on the medium through which the light travel</li>
                                    <li>There is no change in the speed of waves with the moving source</li>
                                    <li>A moving medium will cause a change in the speed of waves</li>
                                </ol>
                            </p>
                            <p>Following James Clerk Maxwell’s equations, which described light as an electromagnetic wave, scientists began debating what medium this wave would travel through. This, in tandem with water waves having water and sound having air. Surely, light must have its medium. This hypothetical medium was named the luminiferous ether, and many scientific endeavours were devoted to detecting its influence on light.</p>

                            <p>In the late 19th century, Albert A. Michelson and Edward W. Morley designed a famous experiment to detect the presence of the ether and its effect on the speed of light. The experiment produced a surprisingly null result: the speed of light appeared unaffected, regardless of the motion of the Earth through space.</p>
                            <p>The scientific community was puzzled. If the ether didn’t exist, what is light travelling from? Various scientists have tried explaining the null result, but Einstein was eventually the one who provided the breakthrough. He pointed out that Maxwell’s equations made no reference to a medium for light at all. Therefore, he reasoned, the speed of light must be constant in all frames of reference and doesn’t require a medium to travel through. This principle of the constancy of the speed of light opened the door to a series of revolutionary and counterintuitive consequences that became the very foundation of Special Relativity. </p>

                                <h2>Einstein's revolutionary consequences</h2>
                                <p>
                                    Wave function for each energy level is determined by the integer value n. Subsequently, the wavefunction also has a corresponding Energy Eigen Value, which is also based on the specific quantized energy level.
                               <br>
                               We know:
                               \[
                               k = \frac{n\pi}{a}
                               \]
                               We also know:
                               \[
                               k^2 = \frac{2mE}{\hbar^2}
                               \]

                               Therefore, by simple rearrangement substitution, we get:
                               \[
                               E = \frac{\hbar^2n^2\pi^2}{2ma^2}
                               \]
                                </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>While 1905 may have been Einstein’s Annus Mirabilis, it was still not his Magnum Opus. Contrary to popular belief, the Special Theory of Relativity was not the reason he received the Nobel Prize. That honour was awarded for his paper on the Photoelectric Effect, which made a groundbreaking contribution to quantum theory. The Special Theory of Relativity itself is incomplete; it describes the motion of bodies moving at constant velocities, but it does not account for the acceleration of gravity. </p>
    <p>A decade later, Einstein expanded this work to include gravity, stories of which could be another post like this. The culmination led to the General Theory of Relativity, which remains our most accurate description of the Universe. It is remarkable to think that such revolutionary ideas were born in a small office, where Einstein spent hours letting his imagination wander. His epiphany on the equivalence of gravitational force and acceleration remains his “happiest thought of his life”</p>
    <p>The beginning of the 20th century marked a dramatic shift in the scientific worldviews, and Einstein was at the heart of it. After the success of General Relativity, he continued to explore the nature of reality and contributed to the foundations of Quantum Mechanics. Einstein remained a sceptic of this theory, famously resisting it like a father hesitant to accept a child he helped conceive. Quantum Mechanics, however, has proven itself time and time again, supported by a wealth of experimental evidence. While Einstein was mistaken in his doubts, this only highlights his deep commitment to understanding the Universe. </p>
    <p>The Special Theory of Relativity remains one of the most elegant and influential scientific achievements of the modern era. Its impact continues to shape our lives in ways both direct and profound. As Einstein himself reflected, <i>“When I examine myself and methods of thought, I come close to the conclusion that the gift of imagination has meant more to me than my talent for absorbing absolute knowledge.” </i> </p>
    <p>And that seemed very Special for me to hear.</p>
