                            <h2>Laying the Historical Foundation</h2>
                            <p>In 1905, a young German patent clerk would forever change our view of space and time. That person, being Einstein, paved a new era in the study of space, motion and light through the Special Theory of Relativity. We will delve into this theory conceptually as well as analytically and see how it redefined our understanding of where we stand in the cosmos. .</p>  
                            <p>Born in 1879, Einstein grew up in Germany, and from a young age, he was captivated by nature’s hidden forces, a fascination sparked by a compass given to him by his father. He was not a child prodigy in the traditional sense and faced constant academic hurdles. Later, through the help of a friend, he secured a job at the Swiss Patent Office, where he used his spare time to think deeply about Physics.</p>
                            <p> Einstein didn’t come up with this theory out of the blue. As we shall learn, a few scientific discoveries and achievements influenced his theory. By laying out this groundwork of scientific accomplishments, we can get an idea of how Einstein was influenced by these ideas, which eventually led to his achievements. We will look at a few in quick successions here below:</p>
                            <p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>The invention of Battery (1800)</b> - Alessandro Volta's battery enabled exploration of electrical phenomena </li>
                                <li><b>Young's Double Slit Experiment (1801)</b> - Demonstrated the wave nature of light</li>
                                <li><b>Electromagnetism and Maxwell's Equations (1820s - 1870s)</b> -  Maxwell showed that the speed of light was the same as the speed of electromagnetic waves, further proving the wave nature of light.</li>
                                <li><b>Michelson-Morley Experiment(1880s) </b> - Set the stage for Einstein's insight  </li>
                            </ul> Even the rise of railroads influenced Einstein as his thought experiments often involved trains and observers

                            <p>
                                1905 marked a significant leap in our scientific understanding as Einstein published 4 major papers that continue to be studied to this day. This is but a small description to all four of the papers

                            <h2>The Nature of light</h2>
                            <p>Earlier on, the nature of light had been the subject of deep curiosity. Was it a wave, or was it a particle? We now have an understanding that it exhibits a dual property. This makes light one of the most fascinating entities in the observable universe. If it were purely a wave, it should follow the basic premises below:</p>
                            <p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Speed of light depends on the medium through which the light travel</li>
                                    <li>There is no change in the speed of waves with the moving source</li>
                                    <li>A moving medium will cause a change in the speed of waves</li>
                                </ol>
                            </p>
                            <p>Following James Clerk Maxwell’s equations, which described light as an electromagnetic wave, scientists began debating what medium this wave would travel through. This, in tandem with water waves having water and sound having air. Surely, light must have its medium. This hypothetical medium was named the luminiferous ether, and many scientific endeavours were devoted to detecting its influence on light.</p>

                            <p>In the late 19th century, Albert A. Michelson and Edward W. Morley designed a famous experiment to detect the presence of the ether and its effect on the speed of light. The experiment produced a surprisingly null result: the speed of light appeared unaffected, regardless of the motion of the Earth through space.</p>
                            <p>The scientific community was puzzled. If the ether didn’t exist, what is light travelling from? Various scientists have tried explaining the null result, but Einstein was eventually the one who provided the breakthrough. He pointed out that Maxwell’s equations made no reference to a medium for light at all. Therefore, he reasoned, the speed of light must be constant in all frames of reference and doesn’t require a medium to travel through. This principle of the constancy of the speed of light opened the door to a series of revolutionary and counterintuitive consequences that became the very foundation of Special Relativity. </p>

                            </section>
                            <section id="3">
                                <h2>Einstein's revolutionary consequences</h2>
                                <br>
                                <p>
                                    Young Albert Einstein was in his patent office, pondering the very conclusion that he would come up with regarding the null result. Einstein is said to have had the eureka moment where he went running to his friend Michele Besso and uttered the line, “Time is suspect”. This realization led to enthralling results, as we shall now see. Time is not absolute, as Newton once believed, but something that depends on motion through space. In other words, time is relative. To cite this, we imagine two people, Dechen and Dorji, each with clocks, perfectly synchronized to each other. Dechen and Dorji both own what is called a light clock as well. A light clock is a setup made of two mirrors separated by a distance d’. In this setup, the light is constant bouncing up and down within the mirror:
                                
                                <figure>
                                    <img src="Img/lightclock.png" alt="">
                                    <figcaption>Light Clock Setup</figcaption>
                                </figure>

                                Dorji sets out on a journey to the nearest exoplanet, <b>Alpha Centauri B</b> , about 4 light-years away. To make the trip within his lifetime, he must travel at nearly the speed of light. So, Dorji boards a spaceship while Dechen stays on Earth, waiting eagerly for her friend to return. 

                                <figure>
                                    <img src="/Img/Dechen and Dorji.png" alt="">
                                    <figcaption>Dechen remains in position S while Dorji, in position S' is moving away from Dechen in a velocity v </figcaption>
                                </figure>

                                Now here is where relativity reveals its strangeness. For Dorji, inside his spaceship, he sees the light bouncing normally in a straight direction. His clock ticks as usual, his body functions naturally, and the ship’s machine operates as expected. But for Dechen, watching from Earth, Dorji’s clock appears to tick more slowly. Not only time, but Dorji’s entire biological experience and even the ship itself seem to run in a slower rate. 
                                <br>
                                This effect is called Time Dilation; the slowing down of time for an object in motion relative to an observer which isn’t in motion. We can mathematically describe this change in time with the use of simple trigonometry. 
                                </p>
                                
                                <br>

                                <p>
                            
                            Take a look at the light clock setup again. In its rest frame (S’) the photon simply travels vertically between the two mirrors. Since the light always moves at speed c, it takes a time T to go from mirror 1 to mirror 2, the distance covered is:

                            \[
                            d' = cT
                            \]

                            This is straightforward for Dorji, who is looking a the setup he has in his spaceship. 
                            <br> <br>

                            However, things look different from the perspective of Dechen, an external observer (S), who sees the entire clock moving with velocity v, In this frame, the photon does not move straight up and down but instead follows a diagonal path. The vertical distance between the mirrors remains d’, but the clock itself has shifted sideways during the time interval T.

                            <figure>
                                <img src="/Img/Light clock in motion.png" alt="">
                                <figcaption>
                                    The same lightclock setup of Dorji from Dechen's perspective as it moves with a constant velocity v
                                </figcaption>
                            </figure>

                            Thus, the light travels a longer path in frame S. By the Pythagorean Theorem, the total distance travelled is:
                             \[
                             d^2 = (d'')^2 + (d')^2
                             \]
                            From the image, we find that: 
                               \[
                               (ct)^2 = (vt)^2 + (cT)^2 
                               \]
                               
                               \[
                               c^2t^2 = v^2t^2 + c^2T^2
                               \]

                               By simple rearrangement substitution, we get:
                               \[
                               (c^2 - v^2)t^2 = c^2T^2
                               \]
                               \[
                               t^2 = \frac{c^2}{(c^2-v^2)}T^2
                               \]
                               \[
                               t^2 = \frac{c^2}{c^2(1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2})}
                               \]
                               <br>
                               \[

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>While 1905 may have been Einstein’s Annus Mirabilis, it was still not his Magnum Opus. Contrary to popular belief, the Special Theory of Relativity was not the reason he received the Nobel Prize. That honour was awarded for his paper on the Photoelectric Effect, which made a groundbreaking contribution to quantum theory. The Special Theory of Relativity itself is incomplete; it describes the motion of bodies moving at constant velocities, but it does not account for the acceleration of gravity. </p>
    <p>A decade later, Einstein expanded this work to include gravity, stories of which could be another post like this. The culmination led to the General Theory of Relativity, which remains our most accurate description of the Universe. It is remarkable to think that such revolutionary ideas were born in a small office, where Einstein spent hours letting his imagination wander. His epiphany on the equivalence of gravitational force and acceleration remains his “happiest thought of his life”</p>
    <p>The beginning of the 20th century marked a dramatic shift in the scientific worldviews, and Einstein was at the heart of it. After the success of General Relativity, he continued to explore the nature of reality and contributed to the foundations of Quantum Mechanics. Einstein remained a sceptic of this theory, famously resisting it like a father hesitant to accept a child he helped conceive. Quantum Mechanics, however, has proven itself time and time again, supported by a wealth of experimental evidence. While Einstein was mistaken in his doubts, this only highlights his deep commitment to understanding the Universe. </p>
    <p>The Special Theory of Relativity remains one of the most elegant and influential scientific achievements of the modern era. Its impact continues to shape our lives in ways both direct and profound. As Einstein himself reflected, <i>“When I examine myself and methods of thought, I come close to the conclusion that the gift of imagination has meant more to me than my talent for absorbing absolute knowledge.” </i> </p>
    <p>And that seemed very Special for me to hear.</p>
